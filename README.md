Gas Protocol

Gas transactions are a massive friction point for onboarding new users. To get someone onboarded, who is entirely new to Web3, they have to create a wallet and possess a native token just to get started with their first transaction. 
If you are a developer with a new protocol, game, or NFT project, this can be where a lot of potential users drop off; as usual, they have to buy the native token with a fiat on-ramp, and usually, that requires KYC.

## Features 

1. Pay using any gas token
2. Gas less transactions for your users.

## 3. MakerDAO Protocol

We make the deposit and widrawl functions gasless.

application that makes use of sDAI, a yield bearing stablecoin
sDAI is an ERC-4626

## 4. TableLand - For Storing the Encrypted Relay APIs of the user in a secure and easily retrievable onchain form.

## 5. Lit Protocol

For Encrypting the relay API key using the v3 Encryption Lit SDK and mapping the protocols with their contract address , whitelisted address and other values.

## 5. Mask Network 

Use of RelationServiceSDK

Develop this groundbreaking solution using RelationService API, exploring use cases from cross-platform profile search to DAO tooling, and beyond.

## 6. Sismo Connect 

Users can generate zkproofs and submit it to get access to the gasless transactions as per the different conditions set by the protocols.

For eg - The condition of having an NFT as a sign of being a member of that DAO.
