Problem Statement:- 

Gas transactions are a massive friction point for onboarding new users. To get someone onboarded, who is entirely new to Web3, they have to create a wallet and possess a native token just to get started with their first transaction. 
If you are a developer with a new protocol, game, or NFT project, this can be where a lot of potential users drop off; as usual, they have to buy the native token with a fiat on-ramp, and usually, that requires KYC.

## Features 

1. Users generate a safe with the help of Account Abstraction SDK provided by Safe. This holds their native assets and allows them to do all the gasless onchain transactions.
2. Protocols register on our dapp by filling up a form and generating an api key for their specific protocols with the help of 1balance and fill up a form on our Dapp.
3.Thereby encrypting their Relay api key using Lit protocol and storing it securely with the help of TableLand.
4. They can even setup different onchain conditions like having an NFT or a token or github account etc to filter their intended users.
5. The users inturn can prove all the required conditions sufficient by their different protocols using Sismo and get whitelisted to access the gasless services.
6. This is how Protocols enable Gas less transactions for their users.
7. We have live integrations with SparkDAO showing how they make SDAI interactions smooth and gasless for their users and ApeCoin DAO where they have their minting and ape staking functions gasless.
8. Protocols can also see their users onchain Data and all their relations in the online arena using the Mask's RelationService. This helps the protocols in verifying that their users are actual users and not bots.

Protocol Integrations in Detail

## 1.  Safe and Gelato

By Account Abstraction we generate a Safe for our Users.
EIP 712 - for signing the meta txns
EIP 2773 - Use Gelato and 1Balance for relaying transactions
