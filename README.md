Gas transactions are a massive friction point for onboarding new users. To get someone onboarded, who is entirely new to Web3, they have to create a wallet and possess a native token just to get started with their first transaction. 
If you are a developer with a new protocol, game, or NFT project, this can be where a lot of potential users drop off; as usual, they have to buy the native token with a fiat on-ramp, and usually, that requires KYC.
